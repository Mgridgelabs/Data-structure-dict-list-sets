# Introduction to Data Structures
Data structures are ways to organize and store data so that 
they can be accessed and modified efficiently.
We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.

# so we have 3 data structures;
Lists: Ordered and mutable collections that allow indexing.
Sets: Unordered and mutable collections of unique elements with
 set operations.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, 
where keys must be unique.

First, let's consider an example without computers in mind, just to get the idea.
 Family Tree
        mother =daughter=granddaughter

 # two different kinds of data structures.
Primitive Data Structures are basic data structures to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

# Abstract Data Structures are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.      
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.
